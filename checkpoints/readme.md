the checkpoint file was fine-tuned on the following dataset:

3D-BrainCT: We collected 18,885 brain CT scans (742,501 slices) from 9,689 patients with Alzheimer's Disease (mean age = 82.59 years [standard deviation = 9.3 years]; 56.4% male) at Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan, between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2022. All data were collected under institutional review board approval (2023- 10-002 BC). Informed consent was exempted due to the retrospective nature of the data collection and the use of deidentified CT images. The CT images included a variety of common neurology conditions affecting the skull, brain parenchyma, nasal sinuses, and the eye, and were collected by radiologists who routinely obtain CT images and write image reports based on the images and the patient's medical records. Since Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive degenerative condition predominantly seen in the elderly, the dataset includes images of normal brains, past infarcts that still show manifestations, chronic brain conditions, and acute brain lesions.
